# CV Maker

This project is a web application developed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, MySQL, and PHP that enables users to create professional resumes effortlessly. It features a user-friendly form for entering personal details, education, work experience, and skills. The website dynamically generates a resume template based on the input provided by the user.

Users can create an account to save their information securely in a MySQL database. After creating an account, they can fill out the form with their information. Upon completion, users can click on the "Create CV" button to see the dynamically generated resume template. They can then preview the resume and print it for offline use by clicking on the "Print CV" button.

This integrated functionality allows users to securely store their information and conveniently generate and print their resumes whenever needed.
